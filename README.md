# Problem: Baba Yaga's Hut Simulation
- User can vary amplitude, frequency, and phase
- See time domain and phasor views

Create a block diagram with a GUI that simulates the Phase Lab. In the GUI, the user should be able
to vary the amplitude, frequency and phase of a signal, and see the time domain and phasor view in real
time. (Consider the QT GUI Vector Sink block.) An excellent version will be used in future curriculum,
with acknowledgment of your work.

# Approach
- Simulated the amplitude modulation hardware from the lab

# Difficulties
- After adjusting the phase,
